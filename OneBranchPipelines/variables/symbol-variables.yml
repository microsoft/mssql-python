# Symbol Publishing Variables
# These variables configure where debug symbols (.pdb files) are published
variables:
  # Symbol paths for ApiScan
  # Must use Build.SourcesDirectory (not ob_outputDirectory) so files persist for globalSdl
  # Files are copied here during build stages, before ApiScan runs
  # CRITICAL: Must use backslashes to match Build.SourcesDirectory's Windows path format
  # When Build.SourcesDirectory resolves to D:\a\_work\1\s, we append \apiScan\dlls
  - name: apiScanDllPath
    value: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)\apiScan\dlls'
  
  - name: apiScanPdbPath
    value: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)\apiScan\pdbs'

  # Symbol server variables come from 'Symbols Publishing' variable group:
  # - SymbolServer: Symbol publishing server hostname
  # - SymbolTokenUri: Token URI for symbol publishing service authentication
