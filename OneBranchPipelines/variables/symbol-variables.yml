# Symbol Publishing Variables
# These variables configure where debug symbols (.pdb files) are published
# Note: Symbol server variables (SymbolsAzureSubscription, SymbolsPublishServer, etc.)
#       should come from variable groups, not redefined here to avoid cyclical references
variables:
  # Symbol paths for ApiScan
  # Must use Build.SourcesDirectory (not ob_outputDirectory) so files persist for globalSdl
  # Files are copied here during build stages, before ApiScan runs
  - name: apiScanDllPath
    value: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/apiScan/dlls'
  
  - name: apiScanPdbPath
    value: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/apiScan/pdbs'
