name: Post Coverage Comment

# This workflow handles posting coverage comments for FORKED PRs.
#
# Why a separate workflow?
# - Forked PRs have restricted GITHUB_TOKEN permissions for security
# - They cannot write comments directly to the base repository's PRs
# - workflow_run triggers run in the BASE repository context with full permissions
# - This allows us to safely post comments on forked PRs
#
# How it works:
# 1. PR Code Coverage workflow uploads coverage data as an artifact (forked PRs only)
# 2. This workflow triggers when PR Code Coverage completes successfully
# 3. Downloads the artifact and posts the comment with full write permissions
#
# Same-repo PRs post comments directly in pr-code-coverage.yml (faster)
# Forked PRs use this workflow (required for permissions)
