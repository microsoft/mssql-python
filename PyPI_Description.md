# General Availability Release
 
mssql‑python is now Generally Available (GA) as Microsoft’s official Python driver for SQL Server, Azure SQL, and SQL databases in Fabric. This release delivers a production‑ready, high‑performance, and developer‑friendly experience.
 
## What makes mssql-python different?
 
### Powered by DDBC – Direct Database Connectivity
 
Most Python SQL Server drivers, including pyodbc, route calls through the Driver Manager, which has slightly different implementations across Windows, macOS, and Linux. This results in inconsistent behavior and capabilities across platforms. Additionally, the Driver Manager must be installed separately, creating friction for both new developers and when deploying applications to servers.
 
At the heart of the mssql-python driver is DDBC (Direct Database Connectivity) — a lightweight, high-performance C++ layer that replaces the platform’s Driver Manager.
 
Key Advantages:
 
- Provides a consistent, cross-platform backend that handles connections, statements, and memory directly.
- Interfaces directly with the native SQL Server drivers.
- Integrates with the same TDS core library that powers the ODBC driver.
 
### Why is this architecture important?
 
By simplifying the architecture, DDBC delivers:
 
- Consistency across platforms
- Lower function call overhead
- Zero external dependencies on Windows (`pip install mssql-python` is all you need)
- Full control over connections, memory, and statement handling
 
### Built with PyBind11 + Modern C++ for Performance and Safety
 
To expose the DDBC engine to Python, mssql-python uses PyBind11 – a modern C++ binding library.

PyBind11 provides:
 
- Native-speed execution with automatic type conversions
- Memory-safe bindings
- Clean and Pythonic API, while performance-critical logic remains in robust, maintainable C++.
 
## What's new in v1.10.0

### Enhancements

- **Active Directory Service Principal for Bulk Copy** - `bulkcopy` now supports `Authentication=ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal`, acquiring tokens mid-handshake via a registered callback so service principal credentials work for bulk inserts (#576).

### Bug Fixes

- **Non-ASCII VARCHAR in Arrow Fetch** - The arrow fetch path now requests `SQL_CHAR` data as `SQL_C_WCHAR` (UTF-16LE), ensuring correct results regardless of encoding settings, locale, or operating system (#575).
- **Bulk Load Connection Timeouts** - Fixed connection timeouts during bulk load operations (#641, via `mssql_py_core` 0.1.5).

## What's Next
 
As we continue to refine the driver and add new features, you can expect regular updates, optimizations, and bug fixes. We encourage you to contribute, provide feedback and report any issues you encounter, as this will help us improve the driver.
